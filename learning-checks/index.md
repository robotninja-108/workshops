# Learning Checks

Learning checks are short quizzes or activities designed to assess students' understanding of key concepts covered in the workshops. Find the topic below to access the related learning checks.

## Tech Fundamentals Learning Check

Do you understand how computers work, the difference between hardware and software, and basic command line operations? What command would you use to list files in a directory? What command would you use to change directories?

## JavaScript Basics Learning Check

Can you create variables in JavaScript, use different data types, and display output using `console.log`? How would you concatenate two strings? Can you write a simple program that stores user input and displays a personalized message?

Try to run the [`basics-fixme.js`](basics-fixme.js) file and fix any errors you encounter! Pay attention to the output from Node.js, especially what line number it says the problem is in. Remember that to run a JavaScript file using Node.js, you would use the command `node basics-fixme.js` in your terminal, making sure you are in the correct directory. Or you can press F5 in VS Code.
