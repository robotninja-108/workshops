## 1. Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, every student should be able to:

- Use lists to store and modify collections of data
- Use dictionaries to group related information
- Write functions to organize code into reusable pieces
- Pass functions as arguments (command dispatcher pattern)
- Define a simple class with attributes and methods
- Split code across two files using `import`
- Read and write a JSON file for saving game state
- Build and run a multi-room text RPG from a structured starter template
- Save and share their code using Git

This workshop is about building programs with _structure_ — programs big enough that you need to organize them.

## 2. Success Definition

A student is successful if they can say:

> "I built a game with rooms, an inventory, and a save file. I know how to break big programs into functions and classes so they don't become a mess."

## 3. Environment & Prerequisites

### Required Software

Before the workshop, students should have:

- **Python 3.10+** installed (see [Setup Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/SETUP))
- **VS Code** installed and configured
- **Git** installed and configured
- **GitHub account** created
- **Workshop repository forked** - or if you already have a fork from a previous workshop, [sync your fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/SETUP#section-4-cloning-the-workshop-repository) to get the latest materials

### Primary Path

- Local development using VS Code
- Python in integrated terminal
- Git for version control

### Fallback Path (If Needed)

- GitHub Codespaces (browser-based; be mindful of [free quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-quota) limits)

## 4. 2-Hour Agenda (Minute-by-Minute)

### 0:00-0:10 - Welcome & Icebreaker

> Low-pressure, creativity-focused

- Prompt (verbal or written):
  > "If you were designing a video game, what is the first room the player starts in? Describe it in one sentence."
- Brief recap of Python Intro concepts (variables, input, if/else)
- Emphasize: today we build something _bigger_ — and the secret is organizing code

### 0:10-0:25 - Environment Setup

> Hands-on setup

- Navigate to workshop repository on GitHub
- Fork or sync existing fork
- Clone to local machine (or open Codespace)
- Open in VS Code
- Navigate to starter code: `cd advanced-python/starter-code`
- Run: `python game.py`
- Students should see the game title and a name prompt

### 0:25-0:45 - Lists & Dictionaries

> The building blocks for game data

Topics:

- Lists: ordered collections — great for inventories
- Dictionaries: labeled data — great for room descriptions

Activities:

```python
# Build an inventory
inventory = []
inventory.append("sword")
inventory.append("torch")
print(inventory)          # ['sword', 'torch']
print(inventory[0])       # 'sword'

# Build a room
room = {
    "name": "Dark Cave",
    "description": "It's cold and damp.",
    "exits": ["entrance", "tunnel"],
    "item": "torch"
}
print(room["name"])       # 'Dark Cave'
print(room["exits"])      # ['entrance', 'tunnel']
```

- Point out how the RPG starter code uses these right now
- Students open `game.py` and read the `rooms` dict together

### 0:45-1:00 - Functions

> Organizing code into reusable tools

Topics:

- Why functions? Show 30 lines of repeated code vs. one function
- Define, call, return values, parameters
- Functions that take a `room` dict and a `player` object

Activity — read and call the existing functions in `game.py`:

```python
def describe_room(room):
    print(f"\n=== {room['name']} ===")
    print(room['description'])
    print(f"Exits: {', '.join(room['exits'])}")
    if room['item']:
        print(f"You see: {room['item']}")
```

- Students implement the `take_item()` function (marked with TODO)

### 1:00-1:10 - Break

- Encourage movement
- Optional: riddle on screen — "What has rooms but no doors, exits but no walls?"

### 1:10-1:20 - Classes & Modules

> Blueprints and organization

Topics:

- A class is a blueprint: `Player` has a name, health, and inventory
- `self` is how the object refers to itself
- Show how `player.py` is imported in `game.py` (`from player import Player`)
- Students implement the two TODO methods in `player.py`

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100
        self.inventory = []

    def has_item(self, item_name):
        return item_name in self.inventory
```

### 1:20-1:25 - File I/O (Save Game)

> Making programs remember between sessions

- Show `save_game()` and `load_game()` in `game.py`
- Run the game, save, quit, rerun — inventory is still there!
- Explain: `json.dump()` writes Python data to a file; `json.load()` reads it back

### 1:25-1:45 - Hands-On: Build Your RPG

> Creative coding time

Progression:

1. Complete the `take_item()` TODO in `game.py`
2. Complete the `take_damage()` and `has_item()` TODOs in `player.py`
3. Add a new room to the `rooms` dict and connect it with exits
4. Run and play through the full game
5. Save progress and reload it

Extension for fast finishers:

- Add an enemy that deals damage when you enter a room
- Add a `"help"` command to the dispatcher
- Add a `max_inventory` limit to the Player class
- Add a win condition (e.g., collecting all items triggers an ending)
- Create a second Python file for room or enemy data

### 1:45-1:55 - Git Commit, Push & Show and Tell

> Save and celebrate

- Add and commit:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Complete text RPG"
  git push
  ```
- Volunteer show-and-tell (2-3 students run their game)
- Celebrate creative room designs and problem-solving

### 1:55-2:00 - Wrap-Up & Teaser

> Reflect and connect forward

- Reflection: "What concept clicked for you today?"
- Preview of what these skills unlock:
  - Web apps with Flask (functions + dicts = routes + data)
  - Data analysis with Pandas (lists of dicts)
  - AI projects (Python libraries use classes extensively)
- Point to the Next Steps resource

## 5. Printed Student Handouts

### Handout 1: Vocabulary (Fill-in-the-Blank)

- list, dictionary, key, value
- function, parameter, return, call
- class, object, attribute, method
- import, module, JSON, file I/O

### Handout 2: Mission Worksheet

- Warm-up check-in
- List & dictionary quick reference
- Function anatomy diagram
- Room planner (sketch out rooms and exits)
- Reflection prompts
- Terminal command reference

## 6. Instructor Guardrails

- Don't explain classes deeply — "a blueprint" is enough for today
- The command dispatcher (`commands = {...}`) looks magical; say "we'll revisit this"
- If a student is confused by `self`, say "it's how the object knows which Player it is"
- `json` is a standard library — no install needed; mention that offhandedly
- Extension tasks should feel like bonuses, not pressure

## 7. Overarching Goals

- Lists and dicts as the natural home for game and program data
- Functions as the primary tool for keeping code readable
- Classes as blueprints, not magic
- File I/O as a practical, immediately motivating concept (save games!)
- Confidence to read unfamiliar code and extend it
- Structural thinking: "how should I organize this?" over "what do I type?"
