# Next Steps After JavaScript Basics

## Practice at Home

- **Create more stories**: Try different themes (space adventure, mystery, comedy)
- **Experiment with data types**: Mix strings, numbers, and booleans in creative ways
- **Use math operators**: Add scores, count items, calculate things
- **Try the Node REPL**: Type `node` (no filename) to experiment with JavaScript interactively

## Get Ready for Interactive HTML + JavaScript (Workshop #3)

- **Visit the new workshop page**: [Interactive HTML + JavaScript]({{ site.baseurl }}/interactive-html-javascript/)
- **Watch HTML basics videos**: Learn about tags, elements, and structure
- **Look at web page source code**: Right-click any page and view source
- **Think about interactivity**: What buttons or forms have you used on websites?
- **Review your variables**: You'll be using them to store user input!

- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide): Comprehensive reference

## Keep It Safe and Fun

- **Save your work regularly**: Use `git add .` and `git commit -m "description"`
- **Experiment freely**: You can't break your computer with JavaScript!
- **Read error messages**: They're your friends - they tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Celebrate small wins**: Every working line of code is an achievement

## Challenges to Try

### Challenge 1: Mad Libs Generator
Create a story that uses 5-10 variables for funny replacements:
```javascript
const adjective = "sparkly";
const noun = "banana";
const verb = "dancing";
console.log("The " + adjective + " " + noun + " was " + verb + "!");
```

### Challenge 2: Character Profile
Make a detailed character introduction with name, age, skills, and backstory.

### Challenge 3: Adventure Score Tracker
Use `let` variables to track points that change throughout a story.

### Challenge 4: Multiple Chapters
Create a long story with chapters using console.log for structure:
```javascript
console.log("=== Chapter 1 ===");
// ... story ...
console.log("");
console.log("=== Chapter 2 ===");
// ... more story ...
```

### Challenge 5: True/False Facts
Use boolean variables to track achievements, abilities, or quest completions.

## Questions or Stuck?

- Review the workshop materials
- Check the [Common Questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/javascript-basics/instructor-notes/common-questions) guide
- Ask in the workshop Discord/Slack (if available)
- Remember: every programmer was once exactly where you are now!

## Looking Ahead

**Next Workshop: Interactive HTML + JavaScript (2/5/2026)**
- Your variables will store real user input
- Your code will respond to button clicks
- You'll build interactive web pages
- JavaScript in the browser!
