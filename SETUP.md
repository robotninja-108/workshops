## Section 1: Operating System Setup

Choose your platform below.

### Windows Users: Installing WSL2 with Ubuntu

**What is WSL2?** Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 lets Windows run Linux tools natively. This gives you access to powerful developer tools.

**Official Guide:** [Microsoft's WSL Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

**Quick Steps:**

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click Start → Windows PowerShell (Admin))
2. Run this command:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

3. Restart your computer when prompted
4. After restart, Ubuntu will open automatically
5. Create a username and password - **Important!!!**: _remember these!_

**Verification:**

- Open "Ubuntu" from Start menu
- You should see a terminal prompt

**Troubleshooting:**

- If `wsl --install` fails, your Windows may need updates
- [WSL Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)
- Minimum requirement: Windows 10 version 2004 or higher

<div class="page-break-after"></div>

### Chromebook Users: Enabling Linux

**What is Linux on Chromebook?** Chromebooks can run a Linux environment for developer tools.

**Official Guide:** [Google's Linux Setup for Chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439)

**Quick Steps:**

1. Open **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Advanced** → **Developers**
3. Find **Linux development environment**
4. Click **Turn on**
5. Follow the setup wizard (may take 10 minutes to download)

**Verification:**

- Look for "Terminal" app in your app drawer
- Open it - you should see a command prompt

**Troubleshooting:**

- Not all Chromebooks support Linux - [check compatibility](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux)
- Requires at least 5GB of free space

### Mac Users: Using Terminal

**Good news!** Mac has a Unix-based terminal built in.

**How to Open Terminal:**

- **Applications** → **Utilities** → **Terminal**

- Or use Spotlight: Press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter

**Verification:**

<div class="page-break-after"></div>

## Section 2: Setting Up Git

**What is Git?** Version control system - save your code history and collaborate with others.

### Installation

Most modern systems will already have Git installed. Check by running:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, skip to the Configuration section below. If not, run the commands for your OS:

**Ubuntu Linux / WSL:** `sudo apt install git`

**Mac:** `xcode-select --install`

### Configuration

After installation, configure Git with your information and set default branch name:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

**Verification:**

```bash
git --version
git config --list
```

<div class="page-break-after"></div>

## Section 3: GitHub Account Setup

**What is GitHub?** A website for hosting and sharing code using Git.

### Quick note on password management

Using a password manager is highly recommended to securely store your passwords and SSH keys. Some popular options include Bitwarden and 1Password. Bitwarden offers a free tier that is quite robust and can be accessed across multiple devices. Teaching youth to use a password manager and avoiding password reuse is a valuable skill for maintaining good security practices. Students will need to have access to their GitHub account during the workshop, so ensuring they can log in easily is important.

### Creating an Account

1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the prompts (free account is fine)
4. Verify your email

### SSH Key Setup (Optional but Recommended)

**Why?** No need to enter password every time you push/pull.

**Official Guide:** [GitHub SSH Setup](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

**Quick Steps:**

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Press Enter to accept default location
# Enter a passphrase (optional but recommended; remember it!)

# Show your public key and copy it
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Then:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Save
5. Test: `ssh -T git@github.com`

## Section 4: Cloning the Workshop Repository

**Forking the Repo:**

1. Go to the workshop repository URL: <https://github.com/Lansing-Tech-Studio/workshops>
2. Click "Fork" (upper right) to create your own copy
3. Choose your GitHub account

**Cloning the Repo:**

```bash
# Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/workshops.git
cd workshops
```

If you have trouble with SSH, use HTTPs instead:

```bash
# Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/workshops.git
cd workshops
```

**Updating Your Fork (for returning students):**

If you've already forked and cloned the repository for a previous workshop, you'll want to get any updates before the next session:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub (github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/workshops)
2. If your fork is behind, you'll see a message like "This branch is X commits behind"
3. Click the **Sync fork** button
4. Click **Update branch**
5. On your computer, open a terminal in your `workshops` folder and run:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

Now you have the latest workshop materials!

## Section 5: Installing VS Code

**What is VS Code?** Visual Studio Code is a free code editor made by Microsoft. It's powerful, customizable, and used by millions of developers.

**Downloads:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### All Platforms

1. Visit the downloads page
2. Choose your operating system
3. Run the installer
4. Follow installation prompts (default options are fine)

### Windows (WSL) Specific

After installing VS Code on Windows, you need the WSL extension:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the Extensions icon (left sidebar, looks like blocks)
3. Search for "WSL"
4. Install ["WSL" by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
5. Restart VS Code

**Opening VS Code from WSL:**

```bash
# In Ubuntu terminal
code . # Opens current folder (the "dot" means current directory) in VS Code
```

**Helpful Guide:** [VS Code with WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)

<div class="page-break-after"></div>

### Recommended Extensions for Everyone

Install these VS Code extensions:

# Close and reopen your terminal, then:
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
nvm alias default lts/*
```

Note that `lts` means "Long Term Support" version, and is a common nomenclature for many software projects. It's usually best to use the latest LTS version for stability.

**Verification:**

```bash
node --version    # Should show v24.x.x or higher
npm --version     # Should show version number
```

### Alternative: Direct Install

**Downloads:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

1. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
2. Download installer for your OS
3. Run installer with default options
4. Restart terminal

**Windows Note:** If using WSL, install Node.js inside Ubuntu (not on Windows side).

## Section 7: Installing Python 3

**What is Python?** Python is a programming language we'll use in workshops 4 and 5.

**Note:** You can defer this until Python workshops if needed.

### Linux / WSL

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python-is-python3
```

### Mac

Mac comes with Python, but install Python 3 specifically:

**Using Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash
# Install Homebrew first if needed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Python
brew install python3
```

**Or download from:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Verification:**

```bash
python3 --version    # Should show 3.8 or higher
```
